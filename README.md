  <h1>Game Development Process</h1>
  <h2>Planning &amp; Wireframing</h2>
  <p>As the <a href="https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/project1">first project</a> in the Web Development Immersive with General Assembly, we were tasked to create a game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. </p>
  <p><strong>Initial Concept:</strong> My first idea was to make a trivia game for aspiring entrepreneurs to learn business strategy.</p>
  <p> I defined <strong>user personas</strong> (Aspiring Entrepreneur, Random Bored Person, and The Mom Test) and considered what features each of those would like.</p>
  <p>This left me with a core set of functionality for my <strong>Minumum Viable Product:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Asks users a question</li>
    <li>Presents users with 4 possible answers</li>
    <li>Notify user when right answer is clicked</li>
    <li>Keep track of score</li>
    <li>No matter what the user clicks, display the right answer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>From there, I wrote 3 plans: <strong>Bronze, Silver, and Gold,</strong> in order to focus on getting the game mechanics to work first, and then begin adding features and styling if I had time.</p>

  <h2>Design &amp; Development</h2>
  <p>I used a <a href="trello.com/b/1AM2yeDM/ga-wdi-project-1-trivia-game">Trello Board</a> to track my development process, including moving each element from initial design through assigning event listeners to quality testing each piece and ultimately launching the site on GitHub Pages.</p>
  <p>I launched and tested the original game, but I was not loving the boring business spin on the project, and my styling was seriously lacking.</p>
  
  <p>After some reflection, I decided to pivot and change the content to be about one of my favorite animals, Otters, and change to a fun, whimsical theme filled with puns.</p>
  <p>I leveraged the sushi background image from the <a href="zendesk.com">Zendesk Website</a>, found my Otter logo image on <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1202893-Giant-Otter">Dribble</a>, and used <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> to generate a complimentary color set. With just a couple hours of CSS editing, the game arrived in it's current state, where I am testing users on Otterly Awesome Facts.</p>
  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>I learned several lessons along the way of completing this project including:</p>
  <p><strong>Commit Early and Often </strong> - there were a couple times where I broke game mechanics by experimenting, and fortunately I was able to roll back to previous working versions that I had already pushed to my GitHub repo.</p>
  <p><strong>Don't Fall In Love With Your First Idea</strong> - as much as I enjoy business strategy, I did not spend enough time making the content fun and in plain English, so I ended up displeased with the outcome. By letting go of my attachment to this idea, I ultimately freed my mind up to be more creative in other ways.</p>
  <p><strong>Media Queries Are Tricky</strong> - as an avid mobile user, I was adamant on making my game mobile-first. However, my skills in this area are not very strong, and ultimately I am still experiencing some formatting issues when the game is viewed on a screen smaller than 500px wide. I will continue to work on this as I learn more throughout the WDI Program!</p>
